# DoD's Use of nonBase Funding
Since 2001, the Department of Defense (DoD) has regularly requested large appropriations to supplement its base-budget funding. Over the past 19 year it represents about 20 percent of total DoD funding.  Most of that nonbase funding has been designated for overseas contingency operations (OCO) that began after 9/11.
## What is nonBase Funding
Based on how funds are appropriated, DoD's budget is divided into to parts:  a **base budget** which includes funding for all anticipated needs; and a **nonbase budget** which includes funding requested for emergencies or special programs that cannot be anticipated in the base budget.

In addition to budgeting for current operations, DoD anticipates future funding necessary to meet national security needs, creating a unified five you plan know as the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  The base budget is the first year of this plan, followed by four other budgets that DoD expect to request based on its understanding evolving national security needs resources will be available. For this reason, nonbase funding is typically omitted from future-years resoruce considerations.  
When nonbase fundings occur on a regular basis, and are a significant fraction of a program, it can create error in anticipated future funding needs.

## Features of DoD's NonBase Funding

-Between 1970 and 2000, nonbase funding accounted for about 2 percent of DoD’s total spending. Since 2001, such funding has accounted for a much larger and persistent share of annual defense appropriations.

-Amounts of Funding. Nonbase funding peaked at 28 percent of DoD’s budget in 2007 and 2008. From 2001 to 2018, it has averaged about $116 billion per year (in 2019 dollars), totaling about 20 percent of DoD’s total funding.

-Use of Funding. DoD’s use of nonbase funding for operations immediately after 9/11 followed historical convention. But its continued use of nonbase funding for what have become large-scale, long-term operations is a departure from past practice.

-Funding for Enduring Activities. F—$480 billion (or 5 percent)from 2006 to 2018, more than $50 billion in OCO funding per year (in 2019 dollars), on average, has gone toward the costs of enduring activities rather than the temporary costs of overseas operations. DoD’s most recent budget request indicates that, beginning in 2019, the department plans to increase the base budget to include most of that enduring funding in future years.
